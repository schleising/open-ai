# simple-openai

This is a simple wrapper around the OpenAI API.  It's not meant to be a full-featured library, but rather a simple way to get started with the API.

The library provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for interacting with the API.

## Installation

```bash
pip install simple-openai
```
